## Usage

![User Homepage to Be Updated](assets/images/appImage.jpg)

Upon login, Users are met with the homepage which presents the newest questions that are deemed to be of interest to the user community. Clicking on one of these questions takes users to the individual question page where a user is able to see the question, along with answers that are provided by other users.

Users are able to vote on which questions become answerable by going to the voting page and voting on questions that they find compelling. When a question reaches a certain vote threshold the question is then migrated to the front page and opened for answering. 

![User Question Form](assets/images/appImage.jpg)

Users can submit questions for potential discussion by using the question form and select a category for their question. Upon submission of the question, users are taken to other potential front-page questions to vote.

Users are able view their own and other users submitted questions by clicking on desired usernames. Users are also able to view questions by category by clicking on submitted question categories. 

# Future Development
* Expanded tagging to allow for multiple categories per question
* Nested answers to allow further discussion
* Allowing for anonymous posting
